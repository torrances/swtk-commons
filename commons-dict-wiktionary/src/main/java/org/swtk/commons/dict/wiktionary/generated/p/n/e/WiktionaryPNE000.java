To figure it out, you can approach it the way you approach any word you don’t know. Take the parts of the word you do know and define them one at a time, finally putting the entire word back together. The first part you see above is \u0027pneumono\u0027, which should remind you of \u0027pneumonia\u0027, a disease of the lung. Secondly, you should recognize \u0027ultra\u0027, which means “very”. Next, you will notice the prefix \u0027micro\u0027, which means “tiny”. Next is the term \u0027scopic\u0027, which means “to see”. Then you notice the prefix \u0027silico\u0027, which is like \u0027silicon\u0027, the natural earth element from which computer chips are made. The next word is \u0027volcano\u0027, which you are probably familiar with. The last suffix is \u0027koniosis\u0027, which refers to a disease caused by dust. By taking all these meanings and putting them together, you will now see “disease of the lung, very, tiny, to see, silicon, volcano, disease caused by dust”. With a little work, you should be able to figure out that this is a lung disease caused from breathing in very tiny silicon dust particles, perhaps from an erupting volcano. In other words, it is similar to black lung, a disease coal miners can have\", \"priority\":15}]}, \"synonyms\":{}}");
