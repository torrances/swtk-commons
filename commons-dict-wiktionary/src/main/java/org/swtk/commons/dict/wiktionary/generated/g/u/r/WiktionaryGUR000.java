The Irish word for “hatch”, as used in reference to hatching birds, is “gor”. The translation of, “the hen is hatching” is “tá an cearc ar gor”. The word is pronounced, “gorrier”, with the “o” sounding as the “o” in the irish word, gorm (blue) or poll (hole). In view of its derivation, this would be a more appropriate spelling. The “u” spelling is the result of the Dublin working class, known as a “Dub” accent, which has a tendency to pronounce the “o” as a “u” sound, for example, world is pronounced wurld, working is pronounced wurking, etc. A rapid “Dub” accent interruption for an explanation would often consist of, whah, whah whah, whah’s thah, whah’s thah, and would sound like the bock, bock, sound of a hatching hen when disturbed.\"}, \"definitions\":{\"list\":[{\"upperType\":\"NOUN\", \"text\":\"spiv, rascal; lout, ruffian; street urchi\", \"priority\":1},{\"upperType\":\"NOUN\", \"text\":\"1954] 1967\u0027\u0027: transcript of w:Patrick Patrick Kavanagh\u0027s libel action; reprinted in \u0027Collected pruse\u0027, MacGibbon \u0026amp; Kee, p.172\", \"priority\":2},{\"upperType\":\"NOUN\", \"text\":\"quot;At the beginning of our encounter I want a definition.
